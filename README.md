# DermAI 1.0: A Robust, Generalized, and Novel Attention-Enabled Ensemble-Based Transfer Learning Paradigm for Multiclass Classification of Skin Lesion Images

This repository is the code implementation of paper - https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/19/3159

In this study, we present an attention-enabled ensemble-based deep learning technique, a powerful, novel, and generalised method for extracting features for the classification of skin lesions. This technique holds significant promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. 

# DATASET 

Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 - a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of pigmented lesions

About Dataset
Overview
Another more interesting than digit classification dataset to use to get biology and medicine students more excited about machine learning and image processing.
