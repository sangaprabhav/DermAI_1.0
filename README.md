# DermAI 1.0: A Robust, Generalized, and Novel Attention-Enabled Ensemble-Based Transfer Learning Paradigm for Multiclass Classification of Skin Lesion Images

This repository is the code implementation of paper - https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/19/3159

In this study, we present an attention-enabled ensemble-based deep learning technique, a powerful, novel, and generalised method for extracting features for the classification of skin lesions. This technique holds significant promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
